    <string name="big_know_more">Recent studies show that notifications triggered on our mobile devices at inappropriate times
can cause interruptions in the ongoing task by diverting our attention, which potentially
delays the task completion, including an increased rate of error. These notifications can come
from any of the app installed on our phone like news app, social media apps, games, and
others.\n\nBased on our response to the notification either read and respond or clear, we want to
develop a Machine Learning based solution to understand our response to the notification
during different times of the day like morning, working hours, lunch, night.\n\nYou are invited to participate in this study of the Intelligent Notification System, which aims
to improve the experience with push-based notifications on mobile phones. This study will
use the notification related data and engagement with it to build machine learning models,
which will help the notification system to learn the appropriate time to notify the user.\n\n\n\n\n</string>
