# Notification Logger

This app can collect notification log data on android devices.

The following notification details can be collected:
* Notification Timestamp
* Notification Posted or Removed
* Unique Notification Id generated by Android
* Current user activity
* GPS Location
* Phone locked/unlocked
* Silent mode or ringer mode
* Vibration mode or not
* Internet connectivity/bandwidth
* Battery Level

The app runs in the background, and auto-starts when the phone boots.

<i>For some phones, we need to give additional permission of autostart to always run in the background.</i>
